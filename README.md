# CSS Grid Exercises

Since I learn coding best by making things, I am practicing building simple and more complex layouts with CSS Grid. 

This repo will contain progressively more complex layouts in each subsequent exercise. Each layout is fully-responsive.

- Exercise 1 is a single column layout.
- Exercise 2 is a 12-column, 2 row layout.
- Exercise 3 is a 12-column, 12-row grid layout.
